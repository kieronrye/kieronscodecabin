            <h2>The code cabin website</h2>
            <p>I embarked on creating my personal website in early April 2024, driven by a desire to establish an <br>
            personal alternative to Facebook. Opting against the quick drag-and-drop starter sites due to finding <br>
            them overly simplistic and expensive, I sought a more hands-on approach.</p>
<p>Turning to ChatGPT for assistance, I generated HTML code for my personal site and delved into <br>
learning about CSS style sheets to add flair and individuality. Over the following week, I dedicated <br>
myself to a mobile app HTML basics course, honing my skills.</p>
<p>Armed with newfound knowledge, I set out to build the site according to my vision. Originally, I <br>
aimed to host it on a homemade server, but with the server still in the planning stages, I pivoted to <br>
using GitHub Pages. By leveraging this platform and making my code open source, I eliminated <br>
hosting costs and ensured accessibility for all.</p>
<p><b>Update</b><br>
    I purchased a domain name from Namecheap an American domain registry company<br>
    I learnt that i needed to pay for a DNS too, I didn't actually know what this was so this was a new experience and fun.<p/>
