                <p><strong>Well well, hello Skibidi Toilet!</strong><br>(That one’s for my second son.)<br><br>It’s been a while, so I figured it was time for a little update.<br><br>
                One of the family backed the winner in the Grand National <em>again</em>—wow, that feels like ages ago now.<br><br>
                I’ve bought a 1965 BSA Bantam D7 (not sure if I’ve blogged about that before). Classic ADHD kicked in, and now it’s in pieces. The dream is to build a trials bike out of it.<br><br>
                On the tech front, I’ve been a bit overwhelmed by clutter and mess lately, so I’ve taken a bit of a step back. That said, I <em>did</em> manage to build a retro game emulator on a Pi 400 using an 8BitDo controller. Totally worth it. Also, it’s really nice having a clear desk again.<br><br>
                When’s the next update? Who knows. Stay tuned!
                </p>

                <h2>17th June 2024. At a Crossroad.</h2>
                <p>With regards to the website development I feel like I have reached a point where it's becoming increasingly challenging for me, either from lack of experience or from my own time restraints.<br>The website is very simple and not much more than a four-page website.<br>(Home, About, Blog, Projects.)<br>Home page and About page are likely to remain unchanged. My focus is now on blogging and project posts only. Again, I'm not sure when or how often.</p>

                <p>Can you believe it? My twins backed 1st and 5th place horses, both winning them some money!<br>(We all have a horse each every Grand National day.)</p>

                <p>One from the archives. I'm proud of myself, and I'm proud of my brother too.</p>
                
                <h2>8th April 2024</h2>
                <p>The website is live, I'm happy with how it is.<br>Still need to buy a domain name and a few little bits.</p>
                
                <h2>3rd April 2024</h2>
                <p>Trying to polish up the unwanted parts of the website.<br>Possibility I might publish the site unfinished and work on it behind the scenes.</p>
