       <h2>Welcome to Kieronâ€™s Code Cabin!</h2>
        <p>Here at my little corner of the web, I've created a space to share my interests and <br>projects. Unlike social media platforms, this site offers a more personal and focused <br>experience, free from the distractions and algorithms of mainstream networks.</p>
        <p>While platforms like YouTube have their merits for educational content, I found <br>myself frustrated by the endless stream of mind-numbing distractions. That's why I <br>decided to carve out this space for genuine connection and exploration.</p>
        <p>One of the great things about building this site has been the opportunity to learn new <br>skills like HTML, CSS, and server hosting. It's been a rewarding journey of self-<br>improvement and creativity.</p>
        <p>Whether you already know me or you're just curious to learn more, I invite you to <br>stick around and visit again for updates. Balancing this project with my full-time job <br>means that the site will always be a work in progress, but I'm excited to share my journey with you.</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
