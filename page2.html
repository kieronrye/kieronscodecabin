            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>My name is Kieron, and I embrace being a neurodivergent individual with gratitude. Despite being <br>
            on the spectrum and having ADHD, I am fortunate to maintain a fulfilling full-time job <br>and navigate family life with a lot of help.</p>
            <p>I am blessed to have an incredibly supportive wife and four wonderful children of our own, as well <br>
            as four cherished Godchildren with loving and capable parents. Our families find solace and <br>
            strength in our shared faith, with Jesus at the center of our lives.</p>
